Johnson, Simon. "{{% resource_link "8b7f15e3-40fe-468e-9b6a-43a010518898" "The Financial System of the Future" %}}." _Democracy_ 40 (Spring 2016). One person’s assessment of what the future might bring. There is no final exam for this course and no need to agree with any of the faculty.

Andreessen, Marc. "{{% resource_link "64b112f2-3381-43c5-a1e4-92f30cf4e80d" "Why Bitcoin Matters" %}}."  _The New York Times_. January 21, 2014. Don’t take our word for it: a big venture capital player lays out his vision and puts money behind it.

Grimmelmann, James and Arvind Narayanan. "{{% resource_link "aa83b063-b4ea-4cdb-b420-4f5fe616a922" "The Blockchain Gang" %}}." Slate. February 16, 2016 . This provides a healthy note of skepticism with which to start our discussions. What exactly are the limits to what blockchain – or any more decentralized approach – can do? How does this kind of technology interact with the legal system?

### Optional

Condos, James, William Sorrell, and Susan Donegan. "{{% resource_link "e344524a-37d8-42e5-a440-b42e693592d2" "Blockchain Technology: Opportunities and Risks" %}}." Official report to the General Assembly of Vermont. This is a measured and considered evaluation. But are they missing something? And should we rely on government assessments regarding the future of technology and its likely impact on society?

{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}

1. What is blockchain technology? How does it differ from what is already available?
2. In what ways exactly could blockchain technology address problems of economic and financial development?
3. What are the likely impediments to the development and application of blockchain technologies around the world? What role are entrepreneurs likely to play?

Nakamoto, Satoshi. "{{% resource_link "61d5004c-74b2-4302-8713-9bd39de18ea4" "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\" (PDF)" %}}. Bitcoin. This is the original seminal paper that launched this industry and much more. Don’t worry if you don’t grasp all the technical details; it’s still a useful reference point. In fact, you might want to print it out and carry it around with you, at least for the duration of this course.

Gupta, Vinay. "{{% resource_link "65f2abf4-44f4-4d84-bac2-d0a95216daa8" "Programmable Blockchains in Context: Ethereum's Future" %}}." ConsenSys. October 21, 2015. This will take you 20-30 minutes to read; it is very accessible. We will return to and debate these questions throughout the course.

Ali, Robleh, John Barrdear, Roger Clews, and James Southgate, "{{% resource_link "d74a089e-51b4-4d95-887f-bb3f112ff9a6" "Innovations in Payment Technologies and the Emergence of Digital Currencies" %}}." Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, 2014. A clear and early statement of central bank thinking on this issue. One of the authors, Rob Ali, will join MIT in mid-October and will spearhead our ongoing engagement with central banks on blockchain- and digital currency-related matters.

Broadbent, Ben. "{{% resource_link "36dc77ac-1700-4741-8b56-414b75f6ac80" "Central Banks and Digital Currencies" %}}." Speech give at the London School of Economics. Bank of England, March 2, 2016. This is an important statement of intent, at least in general terms. Central bankers like to communicate with each other and with the private sector through speeches like this. Broadbent is Deputy Governor for Monetary Policy at the Bank of England.

Frauenfelder, Mark. "{{% resource_link "0b281709-e18e-4557-b191-be853a117c7c" "Bitcoin is the Sewer Rat of Currencies" %}}." Medium. February 17, 2016. The title of this piece is meant as a compliment.

_Optional_

If you want to understand the importance of this issue, start here. More broadly this is an important part of what is sometimes known as “the high cost of being poor”. There is real potential to move forward on this issue.

{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}

1. What are the issues with the current organization of our monetary and credit system? (List at least five problems.)
2. How could the creation of a central bank issued digital currency (CBDC) change this organization?

October 18, 2015. VC Fred Wilson ponders whether the blockchain will result in consumers gaining control over their data and what that means for internet success stories – e.g., Google, Amazon, Facebook, Uber – that benefited from concentrated data control and network effects.

Ito, Joi. "{{% resource_link "eaa642c3-92d4-4f4a-b0b0-2ba2b54605e7" "Why Bitcoin Is and Isn't like the Internet" %}}." A great comparison between the open standards that fueled the internet compared with the open standards behind Bitcoin.

Wenger, Albert. "{{% resource_link "67bcc2ea-5b35-4c8a-82cd-1f844b8fcb54" "Crypto Tokens and the Coming Age of Protocol Innovation" %}}."Continuations. July 28, 2016. Open-access protocols like TCP/IP and HTTP have traditionally been non-profit-making technologies, so they’ve historically been developed in settings like universities, while for-profit platform developers have attracted the best coding talent. With digital tokens, Wenger argues, protocol developers now have a way to profit from their work.

### Optional

Wilson, Fred. "{{% resource_link "a0e16e9c-ea45-4772-a187-69dbf09d601f" "The Golden Age of Open Protocols" %}}." AVC.  July 31, 2016.

April 27, 2016. Koonce puts a lawyer’s eye on a similar question: can the blockchain turn digital content into unique, one-off assets. Can it carry the same “first sale” rights that apply to physical distribution methods such as books and LPs, and wean us off the dominant digital rights management (DRM) model of licensing/litigation?

Nerula, Neha and Marko Ahtisaari. "{{% resource_link "f9da8b5d-6f18-4664-b596-906f95287d76" "The MIT Media Lab and the Open Music Initiative" %}}." Medium.

Mediachain is betting that the first step to building a decentralized system for enforcing artists’ rights is to build a system of metadata that permanently stores attribution to a piece of content.

Rabkin, Milana. "{{% resource_link "ec2369c3-2163-43c1-b236-e5645d78c159" "Music Publishing 101" %}}." Stem. June 1, 2016. A description of how the music publishing industry works.

The Media Lab’s Ariel Ekblaw developed MedRec to give patients’ authority to “permission” custodians of their medical records to share it with other users in a way that aims to protect privacy but also expands researchers’ access to valuable health data.

Ruane, Jonathan. "Insurance Ireland: Project Update." Auto insurance firms face similar problems: they can’t interoperably share information about their customers’ driving and claims records, yet they need to. Might a blockchain-based permissions system help?

1. Can technologies from the developed world such as the blockchain be applied to social and governance challenges that stem from local problems in the developing world?
2. How can or should these technologies interface with local traditions?
